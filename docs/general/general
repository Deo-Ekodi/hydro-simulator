## High-Level Architecture Overview
The software architecture is divided into four main layers:

1. Core Simulation Layer
2. Data Management Layer
3. User Interface Layer
4. Utility and Support Layer

Each layer contains specific components or modules responsible for distinct tasks. The architecture follows the principle of separation of concerns, ensuring that each module has a clear and isolated responsibility.

## Component Breakdown and Interaction
### Core Simulation Layer
- **Purpose**: To manage the core logic of wastewater simulation, including flow and water quality calculations.

1. #### WastewaterModel
    **Responsibilities**:

- Acts as the central model holding the state of the wastewater system.
- Manages the interaction between different components like FlowSolver and QualitySolver.
- Controls the simulation loop, invoking updates and solving functions.

    **Interaction**:

- Initializes and updates itself based on the input parameters from InputHandler.
- Collaborates with FlowSolver and QualitySolver to calculate flow and quality.
- Sends results to OutputHandler for storage.

2. #### FlowSolver
    **Responsibilities**:
- Computes the fluid dynamics of the wastewater within the system.
- Calculates flow rates, velocities, and pressure drops in pipes.

    **Interaction**:

- Receives the current state of the WastewaterModel.
- Uses pipe parameters from Pipe class to compute flow.
- Updates WastewaterModel with computed flow data.

3. #### QualitySolver

    **Responsibilities**:

- Handles the water quality analysis, including pollutant concentrations and chemical reactions.


    **Interaction**:

- Works in conjunction with FlowSolver to consider flow data when calculating quality.
- Updates WastewaterModel with water quality data.

4. #### BoundaryConditions
    **Responsibilities**:

- Defines the conditions at the boundaries of the system (e.g., inflows, outflows).

    **Interaction**:

- Used by WastewaterModel to apply constraints during simulation.
- Adjusts flow and quality calculations based on boundary conditions.

### Data Management Layer

**Purpose**: To handle the input and output operations, including loading configuration data and saving simulation results.

1. #### InputHandler
    **Responsibilities**:

- Manages reading and parsing input files (e.g., configuration files, boundary conditions).

    **Interaction**:
- Loads input data into WastewaterModel.
- Supplies FlowSolver, QualitySolver, and BoundaryConditions with initial parameters.

2. #### OutputHandler

    **Responsibilities**:
- Manages the output of simulation results, such as writing results to files and exporting data.

    **Interaction**:
- Receives data from WastewaterModel and stores it in user-specified formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- May trigger visualizations or reports through the User Interface Layer.

3. #### ConfigParser
Responsibilities:
Parses configuration files to extract simulation parameters.
Interaction:
Provides InputHandler with parsed configuration data.
Ensures that WastewaterModel and solvers have correct parameters to start the simulation.
User Interface Layer
Purpose: To provide an interface for users to interact with the simulation, either through a command-line or graphical interface.
CommandLineUI
Responsibilities:
Facilitates interaction with the simulation via text-based input and output.
Interaction:
Interfaces with WastewaterModel to start, stop, and monitor simulations.
Collects input from users to define or adjust simulation parameters.
Displays results and progress to the user.
GraphicalUI (Optional)
Responsibilities:
Provides a graphical interface for users to interact with the simulation.
Interaction:
Similar to CommandLineUI, but with added visual elements such as graphs, plots, and interactive controls.
Uses visualization libraries to display simulation results.
Utility and Support Layer
Purpose: To provide supportive functions and classes that assist the other layers in performing their tasks.
SimulationUtils
Responsibilities:
Offers general utility functions, such as interpolation, numerical solvers, and data validation.
Interaction:
Used across all layers, particularly in FlowSolver and QualitySolver for mathematical computations.
Ensures data integrity and aids in performance optimization.
Pipe
Responsibilities:
Represents individual pipes within the wastewater system, encapsulating parameters such as length, diameter, roughness, and flow conditions.
Interaction:
Used by FlowSolver and QualitySolver to calculate hydraulic properties and quality metrics.
Updates its state based on solver calculations.
Results
Responsibilities:
Stores the outcome of the simulation, including flow rates, pollutant levels, and other relevant data.
Interaction:
Populated by WastewaterModel during the simulation process.
Accessed by OutputHandler for storage and by the UI for display.
## Workflow and Interaction Diagram
Initialization Phase
Sequence:
InputHandler reads input files -> Initializes WastewaterModel -> Applies BoundaryConditions.
ConfigParser parses configuration -> Sets parameters in WastewaterModel.
Simulation Execution Phase
Sequence:
CommandLineUI or GraphicalUI starts the simulation.
WastewaterModel triggers the simulation loop.
FlowSolver and QualitySolver iteratively solve their respective aspects -> Update WastewaterModel.
WastewaterModel checks for convergence or simulation end conditions.
Output Phase
Sequence:
WastewaterModel finalizes the results.
OutputHandler writes the results to files or displays them via the UI.
User Interaction
Sequence:
User inputs commands via CommandLineUI or interacts with GraphicalUI.
Simulation parameters can be adjusted, and the simulation can be restarted or terminated.
## Considerations and Future Extensions
Scalability: Design the system to handle increasing complexity (e.g., adding more solvers, integrating with other systems).
Extensibility: Allow future extensions, such as adding more detailed solvers or expanding the UI capabilities.
Performance Optimization: Implement strategies for efficient computation, especially for large-scale simulations.
